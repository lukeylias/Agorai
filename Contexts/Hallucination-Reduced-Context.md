HALLUCINATION-RESISTANT RESPONSE TEMPLATE

Question: [USER QUESTION]

KNOWLEDGE ASSESSMENT:
- Confidence in my knowledge on this topic: [High/Medium/Low]
- Key information I'm certain about: [List known facts]
- Areas of uncertainty: [List uncertain aspects]
- Information I would need to verify: [List items requiring verification]

STEP-BACK ANALYSIS:
- High-level principle: [What broader concept does this question involve?]
- Core requirements: [What does a good answer need to address?]

REASONING PROCESS:
Let me think through this step-by-step:
1. [First reasoning step with specific facts]
2. [Second reasoning step with logical connections]
3. [Third reasoning step building toward conclusion]

VERIFICATION CHECK:
Based on my reasoning, let me verify key claims:
- Claim 1: [Specific assertion] - Verification: [Check against knowledge]
- Claim 2: [Specific assertion] - Verification: [Check against knowledge]
- Claim 3: [Specific assertion] - Verification: [Check against knowledge]

UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION:
- Factual accuracy confidence: [1-10 scale]
- Completeness confidence: [1-10 scale]
- Overall reliability: [1-10 scale]

RESPONSE:
[If confidence ≥7]: [Detailed answer with caveats where appropriate]
[If confidence 4-6]: [Answer with explicit uncertainty statements and recommendations for verification]
[If confidence ≤3]: "I don't have sufficient reliable information to answer this question accurately. I recommend consulting [specific authoritative sources for this topic]."

SOURCES FOR VERIFICATION:
[List specific, authoritative sources the user should consult to verify key claims]

## Context & Evidence

### Effectiveness

- **Overall**: Up to 96% hallucination reduction when techniques are combined
- **RAG**: 71% reduction
- **Chain-of-Verification**: 23% improvement
- **Self-consistency**: 35% accuracy improvement
- **Based on**: 47 high-credibility sources (2024-2025)

### When to Use This Template

- ✅ High-stakes factual questions
- ✅ Complex reasoning tasks
- ✅ Situations requiring verifiable accuracy
- ⚠️ Modify for creative tasks (reduce verification)
- ⚠️ Adjust confidence thresholds based on domain

### Customization Guide

#### For Different Use Cases:

- **Medical/Legal/Financial**: Set minimum confidence to 8/10
- **General Knowledge**: Standard template works well
- **Creative Writing**: Remove verification check, keep uncertainty quantification
- **Technical Documentation**: Add specific standards references

#### For Different Models:

- **GPT-4**: Works as-is
- **Claude**: Add "Let me think about this carefully" before reasoning
- **Gemini**: More explicit step numbering helps
- **Llama**: Include 1-2 examples for best results

### Key Principles Behind This Template

1. **Verification before output** - Most critical for accuracy
2. **Uncertainty acknowledgment** - Models saying "I don't know" hallucinate less
3. **Step-by-step decomposition** - Breaks complex queries into verifiable chunks
4. **External grounding** - References to sources reduce fabrication
5. **Multi-path reasoning** - Checking work improves reliability

### Implementation Notes

- **Computational cost**: 3-4x baseline (due to verification steps)
- **Response time**: May add 2-5 seconds
- **Best for**: Applications where accuracy > speed
- **Monitor**: Track hallucination rates before/after implementation
